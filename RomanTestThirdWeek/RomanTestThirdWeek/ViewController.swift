//TL;DR
/*
 For some reason, I'm getting a signal abort error on a random thread number, and it takes me to what I think is an objective-C chunk of code. I don't get it at all.
 I think it happens when the decoder tries to decode a two-part joke. When you try decoding mostly "program" jokes, which most of them are single line jokes, it will work, but it will randomly crash the app. As I said, I guess it's because of the 2-part jokes?
 I thiink it's because I have joke, setup and deliver properties, even tho my JSON can have only joke, OR setup AND delivery... so does this mean I have to create a different DataModel for single jokes and two-part jokes?
 Well, I'm about to find out, as I write this, I'll attempt to do 2 data models. But just so you know, before I wrote this, I only had one. So if you're reading this, it means it didn't work, so at least, you'll already know I failed.
 
 UPDATE: I'm just gonna leave it instead so you can laugh at it... Apparently I forgot to create the "setup" and "delivery" attributes. I had created them before, which is why I added them in my code, but I must've spaced out, but I don't know why they weren't there anymore, maybe I deleted them, or maybe I never did add them in my data model.
 It works now, just so you know.
